## Development Focus & Release Stages

Initially focus on a few basic mods like ElectronicsFramework, BuildingsOverhaul & RadioOverhaul implementing existing code into AIED format & utilising AIED_Core where necessary.
Begin to build AIED_Core implementing the many helper classes i've build overtime into a single mod.
